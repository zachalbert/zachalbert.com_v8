            I have spent a major chunk of my career in startups as a founding
            designer, and in helping new ideas get off the ground. I&apos;ve
            gravitated towards the chaotic energy of new organizations, even
            founding and selling a company of my own. My colleagues and teams
            usually describe me as friendly, easy to work with, and
            knowledgeable. I prefer to believe they&apos;re telling me
            the&nbsp;truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have over 6 years experience managing design teams, and have
            mentored over 500 designers throughout my career (currently,
            I&apos;m a{" "}

            proud of my work as a manager and mentor unlocking the talents of
            other&nbsp;designers.

            I&apos;ve been doing design in some form or another since I was a
            kid. I started building websites on GeoCities in the late 90s, and
            got completely hooked by the power and creativity of the early web.
            Ever since then, I&apos;ve spent countless hours learning design and
            coding to make useful and beautiful things that live on
            the&nbsp;Internet.

            When I&apos;m not at work, I&apos;m usually hanging out with my son
            (currently we are doing a lot of Legos and playing through Tears of
            the Kingdom), watching shows with my amazing girlfriend and our two
            cats, or soaking up all the indoor and outdoor activities that
            Portland, Oregon has to&nbsp;offer.
